# Racing Game
Developing a game using the TivaC microcontroller and the Nokia5110 LCD display. The game incorporates various drivers, such as ADC, Timer, and Interrupt, to ensure clean and readable code. 

The Nokia5110 LCD display provides a clear and visually appealing interface for the game. By utilizing the TivaC microcontroller's capabilities, we were able to create a seamless gaming experience with responsive controls and smooth gameplay. 

The implementation of drivers like ADC, Timer, and Interrupt further enhanced the code's readability and organization, making it easier to understand and maintain. These drivers facilitated efficient data acquisition, time management, and interrupt handling, ensuring optimal performance of the game.
