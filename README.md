# TEST-Racing-Game
Building a racing game using TivaC and Nokia 5110 lcd. <br/>
youtube link for the game:https://youtu.be/kJ_RDARx5VU.

## Supported Features
The game supports random spawning of cars.<br/>
The game speeds up with time in the condition that the car doesn't crash.<br/>
The game maintains a current score and a high score.<br/>
The car is upgraded when a high score is reached.<br/>
The collision of cars causes and explosion.<br/>
The game starts with Multiple lifes.<br/>
The game supports the option to restart after losing.<br/>

## Hardware
This project is about making the race game using Tiva™ C Series TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller which based on ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) architecture microprocessor.
The project uses GPIO driver to control the pins of the microcontroller, ADC driver controlled by potentiometer to control the player movement, and timer driver to control the timing of the game.<br/>
The Tiva™ C Series TM4C123GH6PM offers these features:<br/>

> High Performance TM4C123GH6PM MCU:
>> 80MHz 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4-based microcontrollers CPU.<br/>
>> 256KB Flash, 32KB SRAM, 2KB EEPROM.<br/>
>> Motion control PWM.<br/>
>> USB 2.0 Host/Device/OTG + PHY.<br/>
>> RGB user LED.<br/>
>> Dual 12-bit 2MSPS ADCs, motion control PWMs.<br/>
>> 8 UART, 6 I2C, 4 SPI.<br/>

> On-board In-Circuit Debug Interface (ICDI)<br/>

> USB Micro-B plug to USB-A plug cable<br/>
